      The Timebox habit I am currently implementing is the <i>Pomodoro Technique<i>. I use this to do 25 mins of typing practice every day I am working on my coding. Have I emproved? Give it time. I need it.

        As to a habit technique or two... I like the theory behind Fogg's start small. Two press-ups each time he goes to the loo. So I have added my typing practice to my EDA learnings routine. First thing I do when I sit down to start, practice typing, then go on with the next task. I haven't yet thought of other habits I want to introduce. So still working on that too.
    </p>

        I found all of the <i>Working with Time<i> articles and videos interesting. Right now when I hungry to be developing good habits and techniques to help me through this massive learning curve is great.

        The Pomodoro Technique has been great. 25 minutes is not that long that you see it as a chore, and not that short that it doesn't feel like you've done anything. And doing the typing practice right before I do any of our learnings is a good habit this I have simply added in to my routine.
    </p>

        I will definitely be looking to add more habits to my schedule. This whole learning curve is so big that I want to make sure I get the most out of it as possible. Though I do fear slipping into my comfort zone and taking what I have read and seen so far for granted and simply just bookmarking it all and never thinking about it again.
