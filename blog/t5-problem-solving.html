              <h5>I Remember When...</h5>
              <p>
                Just recently (like yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that...) I experienced a major road block. Between the slope of the learning curve and the nature of the learning my mind stopped. Turned to jelly. Melted away and there was an empty void. Anyway,.. to continue. My immediate technique was avoidance. Don't look. Sssh, if it can't hear you or see you it will go away. It didn't. Then came the nagging talk of defeat. Failure. Worthlessness. Then came the nagging talk of defiance. Put your big boy pants on. Stop being a baby. Harden up. Which, that was fine. But how do you harden up when what you know how to do isn't working.
              </p>
              <p>
                So out came the new strategies. I tried mind-mapping, the Ishikawa (fisbone) diagram, abstraction, analogies, lateral thinking, divide and conquer, hypothesis testing, solution-oriented problem solving, means-ends analysis, research, root-cause analysis, trial and error, proof, snowball groups (in my mind), delphi method, force field analysis,brainstorming, the 5 whys, active imagination, sentence completion, guided fantasy, soliloquy, dialogue, tableauz, role-play or simulation, synectics, argument maps, the De Bono thinking hats, listing, morphological analysis, analytical heirarchy process, consensus (though I was the only one), pros and cons, simple prioritisation, divination, flipism, satisficing, Pareto analysis, futures wheels, cognitive leak reduction, deliberate practice and finally... whiteboard and post-its, and chewing gum. FYI - got an A+ on that assignment.
              </p>
              <p>
                And how did I feel throughout the process you may ask... EVERYTHING. Sadness, madness, anger, frustration, panic, grief, sorrow, defiance, energised, focused, sadness, deflated, defiance, avoidance, humour, joy, sadness, madness, defiance... the cycle continues.
              </p>
              <p>
                And you may ask, what did I learn?... I'm at a time in my life where defiance seems to be more popular an emotion popping in. Normally it stops at avoidance and acceptance of defeat. So, not doing too badly then.
              </p>
              <h5>Problem Solving Techniques For Coding</h5>
              <p>
                So here are a collection of techniques I didn't try (cause thats how your supposed to solve a problem, by looking at everything else). And how awesome I am at these techniques using a scale of 1 - 5, 1 being not good, 5 being awesome:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>2 - Pseudocode</li>
                <li>5 - Trying something</li>
                <li>3 - Rubber ducky method</li>
                <li>2 - Reading error messages</li>
                <li>1 - Console.logging</li>
                <li>5 - Googling</li>
                <li>2 - Asking your peers for help</li>
                <li>2 - Asking coarches for help</li>
                <li>3 - Improving your process with reflection</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                So overall, its looking to average out at about 2.77777778 in the confidence with problem solving area. And I'm not ok with that. Working on it though...

              <h5>JS Array Methods - Just Enough to Wet Your Whistle</h5>
              <code>.filter()</code>
              <p>
                This method takes the contents of an array, compares it against the condition and then filters out the contents of the array that meet the condition.
              </p>
              <code>.map()</code>
              <p>
                This method creates a new array based on another array that is then applied a function to each element in the original array. Eg, a new array made up of the answers to a calculation applied to an original array.
              </p>
              <code>.reduce()</code>
              <p>
                This method is used to reduce an array to a single result. Eg, if your array holds a set of 15 different numbers the .reduce() will apply a calculation to them all to output a single total.
