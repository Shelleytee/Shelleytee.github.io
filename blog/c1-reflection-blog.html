    <h1>The World of EDA as I Know it.</h1>
    <h2>What you think and when you think its the same. <br>
    <em>Captivating thoughts from someone who tries not to think.</em> </h2>
    <h3>1 December 2016</h3>

    <p>
      My take on the <strong>DBC/EDA</strong> experience is that I need to pay attention. Phase 0 is my opportunity to really lay the ground work for the intensity of Phase 1. I am a little bit excited about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My overall impressions are that this will be challenging, hard, exciting, ruthless, fun, challenging, exhausting, fun, evolutionary, tiring, and still fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see myself enjoying the process that this learning culture will bring up. There will be moments that will make me scream, and moments where I will get to be privileged enough to be part of someone else's success, and moments where I will be on the end of tears when I will have a Ureka moment. I look forward to the new challenges it will raise both about me and for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expectations so far about EDA have not changed. I think everything is as it appears to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of learning environment definitely makes me nervous. For so, so many reasons. And for that alone I am excited.
