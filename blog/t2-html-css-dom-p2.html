        <h4>Grid Based Design</h4>
        <p><em>Grid systems bring visual structure and balance to site design. As a tool grids are useful for organizing and presenting information. Used properly, they can enhance the user experience by creating preditable patterns for users to follow. From a designer's point of view they allow for an organized methodology for planning systematic layouts.</em> [Content Care Nov/07/2016]<br><br>
        From a programmer's point of view this allows for a simple and clear way to structure your code, creating blocks of content that can be custom formatted to its location on the page.</p>

        <p><em>Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design aimed at allowing desktop webpages to be viewed in response to the size of the screen or web browser one is viewing with.</em> [Wikipedia]<br><br>
        So regardless of what device, or screen size of the device you are using to view a webpage you will see a clean error free webpage with all its content intake. RWD allows you to set different display looks for the same webpage depending on the screen size viewing it.</p>

        <h4>Semantic Structure</h4>
        <p><em>HTML semantics are a nuanced subject, widely debated and easily open to interpretation. Not everyone agrees on the same thing right away, and this is where problems arise.</em> [<a href="http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/" target="_blank">Let's Talk about Semantics - Mike Robinson</a>]<br><br>
          There are two types of elements in html. Semantic and non-semantic. Non-semantic elements tell you nothing about its content eg. tags such as div or span. Semantic elements tell you clearly what their content is eg. tags such as form, table, article etc. So the semantic structure of a webpage is an accurately described page using tags that clearly tell you what their content is. </p>

        <h4>Psuedo Code</h4>
        <p><em>Is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm.</em> [Wikipedia]<br><br>
        Psuedo code is a tool used by programmers to talk out the logic of a part of a program. It is all text based and is a simple way of summarising how to handle or think out your code before you start coding. This helps to reduce error as it provides a simple structure for you to then follow as you code. It also gives you a reference point for when you are checking errors in your code. Helping to break down each part in a plan english way to compare against your coded process. </p>
