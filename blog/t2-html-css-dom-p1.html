          <p>Is a layout of tags that create the outline, or the skeleton (including skin, hair and nails), of a webpage. All bones, skin, hair and nails (tags) create the structure of how the body (webpage) will look. If you put the bones, skin, hair and nails in an order without thinking about it, you could be putting an arm off the head of the body, and hair hanging from a knee. Which means that everything else that comes next will not fit or look right. By building a skeleton in the right order you know that all the other things you do next will look and work the way you expect them to.</p>

          <p>Is a simple sketch of how your skeleton will look. Maybe you are creating a giant with six toes on each foot, or a cyclops with one eye but two heads. Either way, by sketching out the layout of the skeleton and deciding what bones go where etc, you can put into perspective how the body will look before you start to dress it. After all, maybe you want your cyclops to have no arms, and all their fingers will be in a row going from one ear to the other on top of their head, like a crown. This sketch uses a skeletal structure of lines to show each bone and labels to show the name of each bone and who its connected to. Hair and nails represent the text placement you will have at the end of a collection of bones. By doing this you will know how to layout your body for dressing.</p>

          <p>Is the clothing you place on the body to make it look good. From colours and fonts, to effects and features. So, based on our cyclops with no arms and fingers across its head, our CSS will ensure not to create sleeves that will sit around doing nothing and become clutter, or create hairdos that hide the finger crown. CSS will cater for the hairdo to showcase the expensive acrylic nails our cyclops has. This will make our cyclop look modern and fun, or modern and serious, depending on who will be looking at our cyclops and why.</p>
