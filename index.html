                        My take on the <strong>DBC/EDA</strong> experience is that I need to pay attention. Phase 0 is my opportunity to really lay the ground work for the intensity of Phase 1. I am a little bit excited about it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        My overall impressions are that this will be challenging, hard, exciting, ruthless, fun, challenging, exhausting, fun, evolutionary, tiring, and still fun.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I see myself enjoying the process that this learning culture will bring up. There will be moments that will make me scream, and moments where I will get to be privileged enough to be part of someone else's success, and moments where I will be on the end of tears when I will have a Ureka moment. I look forward to the new challenges it will raise both about me and for me.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        My expectations so far about EDA have not changed. I think everything is as it appears to me.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This kind of learning environment definitely makes me nervous. For so, so many reasons. And for that alone I am excited.

                        The Timebox habit I am currently implementing is the <em>Pomodoro Technique</em>. I use this to do 25 mins of typing practice every day I am working on my coding. Have I emproved? Give it time. I need it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          As to a habit technique or two... I like the theory behind Fogg's start small. Two press-ups each time he goes to the loo. So I have added my typing practice to my EDA learnings routine. First thing I do when I sit down to start, practice typing, then go on with the next task. I haven't yet thought of other habits I want to introduce. So still working on that too.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          I found all of the <em>Working with Time</em> articles and videos interesting. Right now when I hungry to be developing good habits and techniques to help me through this massive learning curve is great.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          The Pomodoro Technique has been great. 25 minutes is not that long that you see it as a chore, and not that short that it doesn't feel like you've done anything. And doing the typing practice right before I do any of our learnings is a good habit this I have simply added in to my routine.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          I will definitely be looking to add more habits to my schedule. This whole learning curve is so big that I want to make sure I get the most out of it as possible. Though I do fear slipping into my comfort zone and taking what I have read and seen so far for granted and simply just bookmarking it all and never thinking about it again.
